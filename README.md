Spotify Analytics Dashboard 🎵

📜 Project Overview:
This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze user behavior on a Spotify-like platform.
It highlights key metrics such as churn rate, skip behavior, subscription insights, and opportunities for growth.

The dashboard is structured into three interactive pages:

Overview – Key KPIs including churn, skips, device type, gender, and listening habits.

Story Behind the Numbers – A deeper dive into engagement by age, geography, and subscription type.

Turning Insights into Action – Business opportunities and recommendations based on user trends.

🔎 Key Insights:

• Churn rate is around 25.9%, signaling high risk of user drop-off.

• Listeners above 40 show higher skip behavior, which contributes to churn.

• Student and Family plans have high engagement but low upgrade rates.

• Offline listening is strongest in India, USA, Denmark, France, and Australia.

💡 Opportunities Identified:

• Smarter recommendations for different age groups to reduce churn.

• More targeted advertising on Web platforms instead of Mobile/Desktop.

• Promote upgrades for Student and Family plan users with tailored offers.

• Emphasize offline-first features in countries with strong offline adoption.

🛠️ Tools Used:

• Power BI – dashboard creation and visualization

• Excel/CSV – dataset preparation and cleaning

• SQL – preprocessing queries

• Statistics – deriving insights from churn and user behavior patterns
